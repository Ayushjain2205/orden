Engage in the NFT community, Buy and Sell NFTs with 0 minting fees.

## 💻🧰How we built it 🔧🔨
ORDEN is built using Next.js for the frontend. The Smart contracts from the NFTs and the Marketplace are written using Solidity. Hardhat to test, deploy and manage the blockchain development cycle.
The NFTs are ERC721 Standard enabling:
- Low transaction and exchange rate
- Fewer intermediation costs
- Faster transactions
- Land data traceability and management power enhance the value of the property.

## Applicable Bounties and Tracks 🏆🏅
- Polygon - The smart contracts are deployed on the **Polygon** network which helps us deliver Zero Minting Fees as polygon as a side chain and its multi-chain ecosystem would help us scale.
- Filecoin - The NFT assets (images) are stored using the Filecoin and IPFS service (nft.storage)
- Portis - We tried using Portis to implement the login functionality

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
